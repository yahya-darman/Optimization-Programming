#Optimization Programming
## GitHub Repository for Linear Programming, Non-Linear Programming, and Integer Programming
This GitHub repository contains implementations and examples of linear programming, non-linear programming, and integer programming algorithms. The repository includes separate Jupyter Notebook files for each type of programming with specific use cases and examples.

## Linear Programming
Linear Programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a system with linear relationships. In this project, we will use linear programming to solve problems such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost, subject to constraints such as limited resources.

The linear programming Jupyter Notebook file in this repository demonstrates how linear programming can be used in transportation planning. In this use case, we have multiple warehouses that supply goods to multiple customers. The objective is to minimize transportation costs while meeting the customer demands and capacity constraints.


## Non-Linear Programming
Non-Linear Programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a system with non-linear relationships. In this project, we will use non-linear programming to solve problems that cannot be solved using linear programming alone, such as optimizing a system with a non-linear cost function or constraints.

The non-linear programming Jupyter Notebook file in this repository demonstrates how non-linear programming can be used in portfolio optimization. The objective is to find the optimal weights for a portfolio of assets that maximizes revenue while taking into account risk and other constraints.


## Integer Programming
Integer Programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome in a system with integer variables. In this project, we will also use Integer Programming to solve problems such as optimizing production plans or resource allocation, subject to constraints such as limited availability of resources and demand.

The integer programming Jupyter Notebook file in this repository demonstrates how integer programming can be used in schedule planning. The objective is to schedule tasks that require different resources while minimizing the total time and cost.

The Jupyter Notebook file shows how to formulate the schedule planning problem as an integer programming problem, implement the Branch and Bound algorithm using PuLP Python library, and interpret the results.

## Libraries Used
For linear programming and non-linear programming, Scipy Python library was used to implement the optimization algorithms. Scipy is an open-source library for scientific computing and optimization in Python.

For integer programming, PuLP Python library was used to implement the optimization algorithm. PuLP is an open-source library for linear and mixed-integer programming in Python.

## Usage
