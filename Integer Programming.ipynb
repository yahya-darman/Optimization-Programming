We can then define an objective function that minimizes the total number of fulltime employees required to meet the daily demand. The constraints of the problem will be to ensure that the total number of postmen and postwomen required for each day is greater than or equal to the demand for that day and that each fulltime employee must work 5 consecutive days and rest for 2 days."
